# Personal Blog Site

## Web development, Dev Journey, and more

A Responsive website where likeminded people will find useful information about web development in general.

### About the Project
The purpose of this website is to share the knowledge I’ve gained about web development. I believe many people will find the blog posts useful, as I’ll be documenting my journey—how I landed my first job, what I would do differently if I had to start over, and lessons I’ve learned along the way. I’ll also share interesting blog posts and resources I discover online.

This project will continue to grow as it reflects the progress in my career. Here's how I am planning to help others with this blog:

- Creating trustworthy content from trusted sources and personal experiences
- In the future will add more features, such as level of experience for the reading
- Easy to understand, so people from different english levels take advantage of the blog
